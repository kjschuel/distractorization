# we are going to need a tree structure.

# I don't think an onject is a good idea because it will be big

# And when I say big... I mean BIG. Like take all your RAM big.

# So maybe we save it to a file. Maybe we make it a json.

# We will also need to traverse this tree... so we will want some sort 
# traversal, checkpoint, resumable aspect.
